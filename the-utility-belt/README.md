# 🛠️ the-utility-belt  

**A simple starting point for new R projects.**  

### Welcome  
Welcome to ***the-utility-belt*** — a tiny template I use whenever I start a new R project.  
It’s nothing fancy, just a ready-to-go script with a few standard settings, packages, and placeholders that save me a bit of time and brainpower.  

It’s not static — it grows and adapts as my workflow changes. Sometimes it gains new tricks, other times it sheds old ones. But it always has one mission: to make sure I start off right.

### ✨ What’s inside  

This folder contains two scripts:  
- [`baseScript_EN.R`](baseScript_EN.R) — English version of the template  
- [`baseScript_PT.R`](baseScript_PT.R) — Portuguese version of the template  

Each script includes:  
- Environment setup (`options(scipen = 999)`, encoding, package loading)  
- Sections for data preparation, analysis, deliveries, and next steps  
- Comment templates for project details, outputs, and future improvements  

Nothing flashy — just a structured starting point to make life a bit easier.

### Why it exists  

Because small setup mistakes add up.  
This script helps me avoid repeatedly writing the same lines at the beginning of every project, so I can focus on the work itself.

### About this space  
Part of [`the-drawer`](../), where I keep small tools, snippets, and helpers. ***the-utility-belt*** is one of those quiet allies — simple, practical, and evolving with my needs.

### 📬 Contact  
You can reach me here on GitHub — and if we already know each other, I’d love to hear how you organize your own starting scripts.

### ❤️ Acknowledgements  
Thanks to all the little mistakes that made me realize I needed a base script — without them, this wouldn’t exist.  

A special thanks to my good friend ChatGPT for helping me write this README.
