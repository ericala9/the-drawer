# 🗄️ the-drawer  

**A little space for unique things still finding their place.**


### Welcome
Welcome to **the-drawer** — my little digital drawer for all the things that don’t quite fit anywhere else. 
Here live snippets, notes, references, documentation and thoughts still deciding what they want to become.  

Some drawers are tidy.  
Mine? It’s *creatively organized*. 💫

### ✨ What’s inside
A bit of everything — and that’s the beauty of it.  
You might find:
- Documentation drafts and how-to notes  
- Command line tricks and helpers  
- Code snippets and templates  
- Random curiosities or side thoughts  
- Experiments that may grow into something bigger

There will be times when this drawer will be overflowing, and other times when it’ll be almost bare. It all depends on my mood — and on whether its contents have finally found a home.

### 🌿 About this space
This is where I store the small, *unfinished*, and *unexpected*. A quiet corner where ideas rest before finding their home, and, sometimes, they just stay here, because they like it.

### Currently in the drawer

Here’s what’s quietly resting inside right now — each one with its own story:  

- [`little-guides/`](../little-guides/) — Tiny, practical notes born from everyday work moments.  
  - Includes [`keeping-secrets-safe/`](../little-guides/keeping-secrets-safe/) — a small guide on safely storing credentials in R.  

- [`the-bellboy/`](../the-bellboy/) — An R + PowerShell duo that politely notifies when new folders appear.  
  A quiet automation that never forgets.  

- [`the-good-samaritan/`](../the-good-samaritan/) — A SAS helper that extracted data when nothing else could.  
  Proof that sometimes even unlikely tools can lend a hand.  

- [`the-utility-belt/`](../the-utility-belt/) — A simple R project starter kit with a base script and standard settings.  
  My way of starting new projects with calm and consistency.  

Every item here once solved a problem — sometimes small, sometimes annoying, but always real. They may be tiny, humble, or even a bit odd, but together they tell a story: of curiosity, adaptation, and care for the craft.
