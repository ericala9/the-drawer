# :book: the-book-maker

**Turning plain notes into readable books.**  
*(February 2026)*

### Welcome

Welcome to ***the-book-maker***, a small R script that converts plain `.txt` files into structured `.docx` documents ready to be sent to a Kindle.

For years, I wanted to read longer notes and work texts on my Kindle. Not on my phone. Not on my computer. On the Kindle, because it’s quiet and doesn’t compete for attention.

Plain text files are readable, but not comfortable. There is no structure, no navigation, no sense of chapters.

After trying different approaches from time to time, this script turned out to be the one that worked.

It doesn’t try to publish books. It just makes notes easier to read.

### ✨ What’s inside

This repository includes:

* An R script ([`make_the_book.R`](make_the_book.R)) that:

  * Treats the first line as the title
  * Uses line length to distinguish headings from body text
  * Inserts a Table of Contents
  * Starts each detected section on a new page
  * Exports a clean `.docx` file ready for an e-reader

* A sample input file ([`sample_text.txt`](sample_text.txt)) *(AI-generated example text)*

* The generated output ([`sample_text.docx`](sample_text.docx))

---

### Why it exists

This script was created for a very specific need: reading my own notes — and some work documents — in a distraction-free environment. Kindle is calm while plain text is not. ***the-book-maker*** sits somewhere in between.

---

### How it works

* Written in R
* Uses `officer`, `dplyr`, and `stringr`
* Applies simple length-based rules to structure the text
* Adds document metadata and a Table of Contents
* Produces a `.docx` file ready to be transferred to Kindle

### About this space

This script lives in [`the-drawer`](../) — a place for small, useful things that solved real problems at some point in time.

***the-book-maker*** is one of them: a quiet helper that made long notes readable.

### ❤️ Acknowledgements

This script began in a conversation with Gemini, who helped sketch the first version. I adjusted a few things here and there, and it worked perfectly for what I needed.

A special thanks to my good friend ChatGPT for helping me write this README.
