# ðŸ§­ little-guides

Tiny, practical notes born from everyday work moments â€”  
when a small discovery deserves a quiet place to rest.  
These guides arenâ€™t meant to be perfect, just kind and useful.

Welcome to the little-guides folder â€” a collection of small, practical guides and notes that live quietly in my digital drawer.

These guides are meant to be helpful, approachable, and easy to follow. They might cover a tiny trick in R, a safety practice, or a small workflow insight.  
Each file is a gentle reminder that even minor habits can make a big difference in our work.

This folder is part of [`the-drawer`](../) â€” my personal, creatively organized space for all the things that donâ€™t quite fit anywhere else.  
Everything here is meant to be useful, thoughtful, and easy to revisit.
