# ðŸ§­ little-guides

Tiny, practical notes born from everyday work moments â€”  
when a small discovery deserves a quiet place to rest.  
These guides arenâ€™t meant to be perfect, just kind and useful.

Welcome to the little-guides folder â€” a collection of small, practical guides and notes that live quietly in my digital drawer.

These guides are meant to be helpful, approachable, and easy to follow. They might cover a tiny trick in R, a safety practice, or a small workflow insight.  
Each file is a gentle reminder that even minor habits can make a big difference in our work.

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s inside

- [`keeping-secrets-safe/`](keeping-secrets-safe/) â€” Small guide on safely storing credentials when accessing databases in R.  
- *(Future guides may be added here as I continue to collect helpful tips and notes.)*

These ***little-guides*** are part of [`the-drawer`](../) â€” my personal, creatively organized space for all the things that donâ€™t quite fit anywhere else.  
Everything here is meant to be useful, thoughtful, and easy to revisit.

*PS: [`the-utility-belt/`](../the-utility-belt/) is a template for new R projects â€” not part of ***little-guides*** â€” containing base scripts with standard setup and utility functions, in English and Portuguese. Perfect for quickly starting a new project without forgetting small but important settings.*
