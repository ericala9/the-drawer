# 🗝️ keeping-secrets-safe

A quiet corner dedicated to one of the most overlooked details in coding: keeping credentials private.

This folder began with a simple observation — how easily passwords can find their way into scripts, sometimes shared without anyone noticing.  
From that moment came the wish to make security feel approachable, not intimidating.

Inside this folder lives a small guide on how to protect what shouldn’t be shared when working with R.  
For now, the guide is only available in Portuguese, though who knows — maybe an English version will appear in the future.  

Each file serves as a gentle reminder that care in our work can start with something as simple as where we keep our secrets.
